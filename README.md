# Hacky - The Hackclub Discord Bot
The Hack Club is a community of hackers from across the globe. I's a super diverse community with people from high school, universities to even working professionals.
Being a part of the Slack channel, i could see many bots but building bots for slack was not something that i was a fan of so i decided to build a Discord bot. Here's how it went.

This was my first discord bot and i used the official Hack Club API to keep track of the upcoming hackathons that were posted on Hack Club's offcial website. The goal was to return the list of all the hackathons but i was able not able to figure how exactly i would do that. For the time being it returns the latest hacakthon that is going to take place and is listed on the website. I will be working on increasing the number of hackathons that i can return.

Credits to the Hack Club Hackathons for providing this API to work with -  https://hackathons.hackclub.com/
